# 🔬 Blood Group Detection Using Fingerprint Image Processing

This project presents a novel deep learning approach for blood group detection using fingerprint images. Leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the model identifies blood types (A, B, AB, O – including Rh factors) by analyzing ridge patterns in fingerprint images.
